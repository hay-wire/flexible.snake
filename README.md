Snake Flexible:
=================

It is a small framework of moving snake made using graphics library in turbo c.
A small snake starts moving around your screen as soon as the program is run.  
You can control it with arrow keys. 
It was initially made for a game, somewhat like the 'Snake' you played in old 
nokia phones, and later evolved into this general purpose code. 
This program can be extended to create your own console based simple games around 
the snake.
